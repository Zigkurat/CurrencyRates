This application was built according to VIPER architecture. VIPER was not designed specificaly for Android apps, but I thought you will be interested to see a different aproach.
It's an overkill for this kind of small app, but it demosntrates the scalability and agility of the architecture. It also implements SOLID design principles and can be easily covered with unit tests, for which I sadly didn't have enough time.

Please feel free to contact me for any reason.
